📌 **Exercise Statement**

This module works with Java collections from the `java.util` package, focusing on creation, manipulation, traversal, and behavior of common data structures. The exercises cover ordered and unordered collections, duplicate handling, iterators, file input/output, and basic user interaction.

### Level 1 — Exercise 1: Duplicates

A `Month` class is created with a `name` attribute. Eleven `Month` objects are added to an `ArrayList`, excluding August. The missing month is inserted at the correct position and list order is verified.

The `ArrayList` is converted into a `HashSet` to confirm that duplicates are not allowed. The collection is traversed using a `for` loop and an `Iterator`.

### Level 1 — Exercise 2: ListIterator

A `List<Integer>` is created and populated. A second list is created containing the same elements in reverse order. A `ListIterator` is used to read elements from the first list and insert them into the second.

### Level 1 — Exercise 3: Capital Game

Data is read from a `countries.txt` file containing country–capital pairs. The data is stored in a `HashMap<String, String>`.

The program requests the user’s name and performs 10 rounds. In each round, a random country is selected and the user inputs the corresponding capital. Correct answers increase the score.

After the final round, the total score is displayed and the user’s name and score are written to a `classification.txt` file.
